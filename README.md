# Credit Card Checker

## Description

As part of Codecademy's [Back-End Engineer Career Path](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/back-end-engineer-career-path), I was tasked with developing a program using JavaScript that determines whether provided credit card numbers are valid. This independent project tested my knowledge and application of callback and high-order functions, loops, and iterators, among other intermediate programming topics.

## Insights

I have taken away the following insights while working on this project:

* Iterators are a powerful alternative to loops and conditional statements that can help make Javascript programs more straightforward to interpret.
* When operationalizing complicated logic, it can be helpful to approach the task by starting with the desired outcome and working "backward."

## Enhancements

As I develop my skills further, I plan to return to this project to identify potential opportunities for optimization and utilize techniques I have since learned. I will outline such enhancements as I implement them below.
